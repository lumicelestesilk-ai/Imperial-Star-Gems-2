# Imperial Star Gems

A multi-page storefront for loose natural and lab-grown diamonds. There is no cart
and no price anywhere on the site — every stone ends in an enquiry.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # fill in the contact details
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

The converted frames are already in `public/sequence`, so the app runs without
re-running the conversion step.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run sequence:convert` | Rebuilds `public/sequence` from the raw PNGs |

---

## The two image sequences

The site runs two frame sequences. They are **fully independent** — separate
folders, separate components, separate canvases, separate frame caches, separate
playback drivers. Neither reads or writes the other's state.

| | Scroll-driven hero | 360° rotation loop |
|---|---|---|
| Component | [`hero-sequence.tsx`](src/components/hero-sequence.tsx) | [`diamond-rotation.tsx`](src/components/diamond-rotation.tsx) |
| Frames | `scroll/00001.webp` – `00700.webp` | `rotate/00001.webp` – `00NNN.webp` |
| Driven by | Scroll position (GSAP ScrollTrigger) | `requestAnimationFrame` at 30 fps |
| Direction | Scroll down plays forward, scroll up plays in reverse | Loops forward; drag or arrow keys turn it either way |
| Used on | Home page hero | Home page, and inside every stone's enquiry drawer |

### File naming

Every folder is numbered **from `00001`**, five digits, `.webp`. The components
work in 0-based indices internally; the `+1` happens in exactly one place,
`frameUrl()` in [`src/lib/sequence.ts`](src/lib/sequence.ts) — index 0 is
`00001.webp`, index 699 is `00700.webp`. Frame counts come from
`src/data/sequence-manifest.json`, which the conversion script writes, so no
component hard-codes a count.

### Sources

| Input folder (gitignored) | Contents | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/sequence/raw-700/` | 700 PNGs, rough crystal to finished radiant, from `github.com/Murali2011/sequenceimages` | `scroll/`, `scroll-mobile/` |
| `assets/sequence/raw-360/` | **Not yet supplied.** The dedicated 333-frame turntable render | `rotate/` |

The raw GitHub repos are one-time build inputs. **The live site never references
GitHub** in development or production.

An earlier build used `Murali2011/update-sequence` instead. It has four
never-published indices, four zero-byte files and four truncated PNGs; the
`sequenceimages` repo is the same render with all 700 frames intact, so it
replaced it.

### The 360° frames are a stand-in until the real render arrives

No 333-frame turntable exists in any of the `Murali2011` repositories — every
longer render there is another rough-to-polished sequence. Until the real frames
are supplied, `rotate/` is built from the end of the 700-frame render: source
frames 630–699, where the finished stone turns from a three-quarter view to face
up, played forward and then back so the loop has no jump. That is **138 frames,
and a partial turn rather than a full 360°.** The manifest records this in
`tiers.rotate.source`.

To ship the real rotation:

1. Put the 333 PNGs in `assets/sequence/raw-360/` (any 5-digit numbering).
2. Run `npm run sequence:convert`.

The script detects the folder, uses those frames one for one, writes
`rotate/00001.webp` – `00333.webp`, updates the manifest, and warns if the count
is not 333. No code changes.

### What gets built

`npm run sequence:convert` validates every source frame with a full decode (a
header read does not catch a truncated PNG), drops anything empty or
undecodable, then writes:

| Folder | Frames | Width | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scroll/` | 700 | 1080px (source resolution) | 7.4 MB |
| `scroll-mobile/` | 234 (every 3rd) | 900px | 1.7 MB |
| `rotate/` | 138 stand-in, 333 once supplied | 720px | 0.9 MB |

Frames are flattened onto the porcelain background (`#FAFAFA`) rather than
keeping an alpha channel — they render on that ground everywhere.

### Serving from a CDN

Upload `public/sequence/` to an asset CDN (Cloudflare R2, Bunny, Vercel Blob,
S3+CloudFront) and set:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEQUENCE_BASE_URL=https://cdn.imperialstargems.com/sequence
```

Every frame URL goes through `frameUrl()`, so that one variable moves both
sequences. Unset, it falls back to the local `/sequence` folder.
`next.config.ts` sets a one-year immutable cache header on that path.

### Scroll-driven hero

- A `<canvas>` draws one frame at a time. ScrollTrigger pins the hero and scrubs
  across six further viewport heights (seven in total).
- Scroll progress maps to `Math.round(progress * (count - 1))`, and `drawImage`
  runs only when that index actually changes.
- Frames load in batches of 48 across 8 lanes, started by an
  `IntersectionObserver`. Frame 1 loads first and draws immediately; scrubbing
  ahead of the loader holds the nearest loaded frame rather than blanking, and the
  frame under the playhead always jumps the queue.
- Narrow screens (≤ 900px) load `scroll-mobile/` instead.
- GSAP is loaded with a dynamic `import()`, so it stays out of other routes'
  bundles.

**There is no `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback on the hero, deliberately.** The
sequence only moves while the visitor is scrolling and stops the instant they
stop — it is direct manipulation, not autoplaying motion. It previously swapped
in a single static poster under reduced motion, and Windows Server, RDP sessions
and many power-saving configurations report reduced motion by default, so on
those machines the hero was one image that never changed.

### 360° rotation loop

- Autoplays at 30 fps once every frame is loaded, looping continuously.
- **Drag** turns the stone by hand — one full-width drag is one full turn — and
  autoplay does not fight the pointer while the button is held. **Arrow keys**
  step one frame (Shift for larger steps); Home and End jump to the ends.
- Autoplay resumes 1.8 s after the visitor lets go. Hovering does not pause it.
- A visible **Pause / Play** button is always present.
- It stops drawing entirely when scrolled off screen or when the tab is hidden.
- With `prefers-reduced-motion` it **starts paused**; Play starts it. Unlike the
  hero, this one does move on its own, so the preference applies.
- A vertical swipe on the viewer still scrolls the page on touch screens
  (`touch-action: pan-y`); only horizontal movement turns the stone.
- The slider's `aria-valuenow` / `aria-valuetext` track the frame actually on
  screen, including during autoplay.

### How this was verified

In headless Chrome against the running app, under both `prefers-reduced-motion`
settings, by reading canvas pixels and wrapping `drawImage` to log which frame
each canvas drew:

- **Hero:** six scroll positions produce six different frames; scrolling back up
  reproduces the exact earlier frame (reverse playback). Identical results with
  and without reduced motion.
- **Rotation:** about 90 sequential frames drawn per 3 s of autoplay, each exactly
  one frame after the last, all from `rotate/`; zero draws while paused; drag and
  keys change the frame; reduced motion starts paused and Play starts it.
- **Independence:** across a full session, zero draws of a `rotate/` frame onto
  the hero canvas or a `scroll/` frame onto the rotation canvas, with the hero
  scrubbing while the loop was live.

## Design system

Tokens live in [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) under `@theme`.
Tailwind's default palette is **cleared wholesale** (`--color-*: initial`) so a
stray `text-gray-500` fails loudly instead of quietly going off-brand.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `porcelain` | `#FAFAFA` | Page background |
| `panel` | `#EFEDEA` | Alternating section bands |
| `ink` | `#17181B` | Primary text |
| `ink-muted` | `#6E6D69` | Secondary text **on porcelain only** |
| `ink-muted-panel` | `#63625E` | Secondary text on panel bands |
| `hairline` | `#D8D6D1` | Borders, dividers |
| `metal` | `#B9B6AE` | Icon strokes and rules — **never text** |
| `facet` | `#DCEAF0` | Hover and active states only |

### Contrast

```
ink             on porcelain   17.1 : 1   pass
ink             on panel       15.2 : 1   pass
ink-muted       on porcelain    4.96: 1   pass
ink-muted       on panel        4.43: 1   FAILS AA
ink-muted-panel on panel        5.23: 1   pass
metal           on porcelain    1.94: 1   decoration only
```

`--ink-muted` at the briefed `#6E6D69` clears AA on porcelain but lands just under
it on the panel ground, so `--ink-muted-panel` exists for panel sections.

### Type and shape

- Display: **Instrument Serif**. Body: **DM Sans**. Both via `next/font`,
  self-hosted at build time — the build needs network access for the initial
  font fetch.
- Body copy is capped by a `measure` utility at 62ch.
- Radii scale by element size: pill CTAs, 22px cards, 36px panels, 10–12px chips
  and inputs.

### Motion

Two sequences carry the motion: the scroll-driven hero and the rotation loop.
There is no fade-slide-up on scroll anywhere else — every other transition
answers a user action: hover, focus, opening the drawer, changing a filter.

---

## The shape system

Eleven cuts drawn as hairline plotting diagrams in
[`src/lib/glyphs.ts`](src/lib/glyphs.ts), serving as catalogue navigation, card
imagery and the brand's technical mark. Strokes use
`vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`. On hover or keyboard focus the outline fills
with the cool glint and the facet lines draw in from the girdle, staggered —
pure CSS on `pathLength="1"`. Clicking a glyph filters the catalogue via
`?shape=<slug>`.

---

## Enquiry flow

No price exists anywhere — not on a card, not in a data attribute, not in the
serialized props.

`Enquire` opens a drawer ([`enquiry-drawer.tsx`](src/components/enquiry-drawer.tsx))
with the SKU, its own instance of the rotation loop, the full specification, and
three contact paths:

1. **WhatsApp** — `https://wa.me/<number>?text=<url-encoded message>`
2. **Email** — `mailto:` with subject and body pre-filled
3. **In-page form** — posts to `/api/enquiry`, because `mailto:` silently does
   nothing for anyone without a configured mail client

The drawer traps focus, closes on Escape, locks body scroll without shifting the
layout, and restores focus to the button that opened it.

`POST /api/enquiry` validates, requires an email **or** a phone, runs a honeypot,
and rate-limits to 5/minute per IP. Set `ENQUIRY_WEBHOOK_URL` to deliver
somewhere; without it the route accepts and logs a warning.

> The in-memory rate limiter does not survive a restart and is not shared between
> serverless instances. Put a real limiter or a WAF rule in front of it before
> launch.

SKUs are the supplier's own references (`TP-280626-3329` lab-grown, `OM-1026`
natural). Stock lives in `src/lib/real-stones.ts` (lab-grown) and
`src/lib/real-natural-stones.ts` (natural).

## Before this goes live

- **The 333-frame 360° render.** `rotate/` is currently a 138-frame stand-in
  showing a partial turn. See *The 360° frames are a stand-in* above.
- **Contact details** — email, phone and WhatsApp are hard-coded in
  [`src/lib/contact.ts`](src/lib/contact.ts). Confirm they are current.
- **Inventory.** The 121 stones in [`src/lib/stones.ts`](src/lib/stones.ts) are
  generated from a seeded PRNG, not real stock. Replace `buildCatalog` with the
  live feed and delete `INVENTORY_NOTICE` and its two usages.
- **Certificate numbers** are deliberately not generated; wire real report
  numbers in with the real inventory.
- **Sourcing and ethics copy** on `/craftsmanship` states standard trade
  positions. Confirm each is true of the business before publishing.
- **`metadataBase`** in `src/app/layout.tsx`, plus the domain in `sitemap.ts` and
  `robots.ts`, if the production domain differs.

---

## Not built

- **Draggable per-shape sequences** for the shape grid. They need 36–72 rendered
  frames for each of the eleven shapes, and only the radiant exists. The grid
  ships with the SVG wireframe-to-glint interaction; the drag-a-frame-sequence
  technique is already implemented in `diamond-rotation.tsx`, so per-shape assets
  can be wired in later without new playback code.
- **three.js wireframe gem.** A stretch goal; `react-three-fiber` is not
  installed.
