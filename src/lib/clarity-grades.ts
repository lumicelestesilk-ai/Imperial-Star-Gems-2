 * The FL–I3 clarity scale and the illustrative 10x loupe views that go with it.

 * components, and a value import would pull the whole stone catalogue into the
 * browser bundle.
 *
 * The loupe views are drawn, not photographed. They show how inclusions grow
 * in number, size and contrast down the scale, but a grade reflects how
 * visible inclusions are — their size, nature, position and relief — not a
 * count, so no drawing stands in for a real plot.
