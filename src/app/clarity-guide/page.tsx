const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "What clarity grade is 'eye-clean'?",
    answer:
      "Eye-clean is not a laboratory grade. It means no inclusion is visible without magnification at a normal viewing distance. VS2 and above are almost always eye-clean; many SI1 stones are, and some SI2 stones. It depends on the stone's size, its shape and where the inclusions sit, so it is judged stone by stone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is VVS clarity worth the extra cost?",
    answer:
      "Rarely for how the stone looks. VVS inclusions are extremely hard to find even at 10x, and a VS or eye-clean SI stone looks the same to the eye. VVS is worth paying for when rarity matters to you, in large step cuts, or where lab-grown makes the higher grade affordable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do inclusions affect a diamond's durability?",
    answer:
      "Usually not. Most inclusions are tiny and deep inside the stone. The exceptions are large feathers that reach the surface, especially near a girdle, point or corner, which can weaken the stone under a hard knock. They are most common in the I grades and worth checking on the plot.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between an inclusion and a blemish?",
    answer:
      "An inclusion is inside the stone: a crystal, a feather, a pinpoint or a cloud. A blemish is on the surface: a polish line, a nick, a scratch or an extra facet. Both count towards the clarity grade, but inclusions usually decide it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do GIA and IGI grade clarity the same way?",
    answer:
      "Both grade on the same FL to I3 scale, under 10x magnification, and the grade names mean the same thing on either report. How strictly each laboratory applies the scale is debated in the trade, so read any single grade as a starting point and look at the plot and the stone.",
